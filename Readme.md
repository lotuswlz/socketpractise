1. I want to write a simple server to receive data from each client.
2. The simple server will not stop. We can use the "while(true)" expression.
3. Write an android or other client to send message, and this client need both socket server and client, it need a returned
   message as the result after sending message to server.
4. If necessarily, we can add the http server to access this socket server to browse the information via browsers.
